## Sources
I collected my data from the SEC's [2024 Q1 Metrics by Individual Security](https://www.sec.gov/about/marketstructuredata-security) dataset, which provides day-to-day metrics for over 4,800 US securities from January 1st 2024 to March 28th 2024.

## Data Cleaning

In the market capitalization rank and volatility rank columns, the SEC assigns each security a ranking between 1 - 10, with 1 being the lowest outcome and 10 being the highest. For readability purposes, I sorted each rank into three categories: low, middle, and high. I further cleaned this dataset by renaming columns to in an R-friendly format, filtering out other securities, and using the sample function to randomly select 10,000 out of 85,516 stocks to use in my analysis.
